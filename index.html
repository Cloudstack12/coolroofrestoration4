                        Ridge caps are specially designed toppers for your roof and come in different formats depending upon your roof type. Their function is to create a seal at the ridgeline to direct rainwater down the roof slope and away from your attic space.

                                Roof ridge cap repair in Darwin involves a complete inspection of your roof for leaks and loose materials. Large birds or plant life damage the materials causing them to become defective and create leaks.

                                Damaged materials reduce the effectiveness of keeping water out of your home which can cause damage to the interior. Roof ridge cap repair in Darwin ensures that the peak of your roof is protected and prevents water from seeping under shingles, tiles or metal, keeping the inside of your home dry.
